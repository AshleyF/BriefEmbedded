[Full documentation here](Documents/README.md). The code itself contains literate style documentation as well.

This is a fork [from here](http://github.com/ashleyf/brief/tree/gh-pages/embedded), but simplified by removing Reflecta, IL translation and several instructions. This is the most active fork now-a-days.
